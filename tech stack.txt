FindYourWay is a full-stack Spring application that will asks users a series of questions. 
Based on the users' locations and responses, FindYourWay will gives recommendations for the users to choose from.

Leveraging, Google's Place and Maps API, the application is able to pull the recommended establismentments' information for the area. 
The users are then able to view, choose, and also save a recommended destination. 

Utilizing Angular and Bootstrap for the front end, we allow the user to register/login into their account, 
and save their favorite locations, which is persisted in our Oracle database with the assistance of the Hibernate ORM Framework. 

Users will be able to gain points based on their actions and they are able to cash in these points to obtain badges and coupons.
